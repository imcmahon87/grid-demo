# Responsive Grid Styling

This landing page for a book review website is based on a front end coding
challenge on Frontend Mentor's website (https://www.frontendmentor.io).
It demonstrates responsive design using a CSS grid container. Sometimes the 
cleanest results are from a purely HTML/CSS approach, and this small project
aims to demonstrate this.
